# Next Steps - Authentication & Playwright Testing

## ‚úÖ Completed

I've successfully implemented password authentication and created comprehensive Playwright tests for automated testing. Here's what's been done:

### 1. Password Authentication Implementation

**Updated Files:**
- `app/auth/login/page.tsx` - Added password authentication with toggle
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added authentication guard with redirect
- `SETUP-TEST-USER.md` - Complete setup instructions for test user

**Features Added:**
- Password login form with email and password fields
- Toggle between magic link and password authentication
- Test credentials displayed on login page for convenience
- Authentication check on dashboard with redirect to login if not authenticated
- User email displayed in dashboard header

### 2. Playwright Automated Testing

**Created Files:**
- `tests/document-analysis.spec.ts` - Comprehensive end-to-end tests
- `playwright.config.ts` - Playwright configuration
- `tests/README.md` - Complete testing documentation
- `tests/screenshots/` - Directory for test screenshots

**Updated Files:**
- `package.json` - Added Playwright dependency and test scripts
- `.gitignore` - Excluded Playwright artifacts

**Test Coverage:**
- ‚úÖ Complete workflow: Login ‚Üí Upload ‚Üí Prompts ‚Üí Models ‚Üí Results
- ‚úÖ Document upload and text extraction
- ‚úÖ Model selection and configuration
- ‚úÖ LLM inference execution
- ‚úÖ Results verification and export
- ‚úÖ Authentication guards
- ‚úÖ Error handling

### 3. Fixed Issues

**Resolved webpack cache issue:**
- Duplicate `supabase` declaration was a cache problem
- Cleared `.next` cache and verified clean compilation
- Application now running on http://localhost:3000 without errors

## üöÄ What You Need to Do Next

### Step 1: Enable Password Authentication in Supabase (5 minutes)

1. **Go to Supabase Auth Settings:**
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ughfpgtntupnedjotmrr/auth/providers

2. **Configure Email Provider:**
   - Find "Email" in the providers list
   - Click on it to configure
   - ‚úÖ Enable Email provider: **ON**
   - ‚úÖ Enable sign ups: **ON**
   - ‚ùå Confirm email: **OFF** (Important for testing!)
   - Click "Save"

### Step 2: Create Test User (2 minutes)

**Option A: Via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)**

1. **Go to Users Page:**
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ughfpgtntupnedjotmrr/auth/users

2. **Click "Add user" button**

3. **Fill in the form:**
   - Email: `test@playwright.local`
   - Password: `TestPassword123!`
   - ‚úÖ Auto Confirm User: **Check this box!**

4. **Click "Create user"**

**Option B: Via SQL Editor**

If the dashboard method doesn't work:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ughfpgtntupnedjotmrr/sql/new

2. Copy and run the SQL from `SETUP-TEST-USER.md` (lines 42-72)

### Step 3: Install Playwright (2 minutes)

```bash
cd /c/Project/LLM-backend

# Install dependencies (includes Playwright)
npm install

# Install Chromium browser for Playwright
npx playwright install chromium
```

This installs Playwright and the Chromium browser needed for testing.

### Step 4: Test Password Login Manually (1 minute)

Before running automated tests, verify the password login works:

1. **Navigate to:** http://localhost:3000/auth/login

2. **Click** "Use password instead"

3. **Enter credentials:**
   - Email: `test@playwright.local`
   - Password: `TestPassword123!`

4. **Click** "Sign in with password"

5. **You should be redirected to the dashboard** ‚úÖ

If this works, you're ready for automated testing!

### Step 5: Run Playwright Tests (30-60 seconds)

```bash
# Run all tests (headless mode)
npm test

# OR run with visible browser (recommended first time)
npm run test:headed

# OR run with interactive UI mode
npm run test:ui
```

**What the test does:**

1. Logs in with password credentials
2. Uploads `Sample documents/test-contract-arlanda.txt`
3. Waits for text extraction (Edge Function)
4. Configures Swedish contract prompts
5. Selects free models (Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 7B)
6. Runs LLM inference (30-60 seconds)
7. Verifies results are displayed
8. Tests export functionality
9. Saves screenshot to `tests/screenshots/`

**Expected cost:** $0.00 (uses free models only)

### Step 6: View Test Results

```bash
# Open HTML test report
npm run test:report
```

This shows:
- Test execution timeline
- Pass/fail status for each test
- Screenshots and videos (if any failures)
- Execution metrics

## üîç Verification Checklist

Before reporting issues, verify:

- [ ] Dev server is running: http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Email/password auth is enabled in Supabase
- [ ] Test user exists: `test@playwright.local`
- [ ] Test user has "Auto Confirm User" checked
- [ ] You can login manually with password
- [ ] Playwright is installed: `npx playwright --version`
- [ ] Chromium browser is installed: `npx playwright install chromium`
- [ ] Sample document exists: `Sample documents/test-contract-arlanda.txt`
- [ ] Edge Functions are deployed: `extract-text` and `run-llm-inference`
- [ ] OpenRouter API key is set in Supabase secrets

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Invalid login credentials" error

**Cause:** Test user doesn't exist or email auth not enabled

**Solution:**
1. Check Supabase Auth ‚Üí Providers ‚Üí Email is enabled
2. Check Supabase Auth ‚Üí Users ‚Üí test@playwright.local exists
3. If user exists but login fails, delete and recreate with "Auto Confirm User" checked

### "Cannot connect to localhost:3000"

**Cause:** Dev server not running

**Solution:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### "Upload failed" or "Text extraction failed"

**Cause:** Edge Function not deployed or failing

**Solution:**
1. Check Edge Function logs: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ughfpgtntupnedjotmrr/functions
2. Verify `extract-text` function is deployed
3. Check function logs for errors

### "Inference timeout" or "No results"

**Cause:** OpenRouter API key not set or function failing

**Solution:**
1. Verify OpenRouter secret is set in Supabase
2. Check `run-llm-inference` function logs
3. Try increasing timeout in `playwright.config.ts`

### Playwright installation issues

```bash
# Uninstall and reinstall
npm uninstall @playwright/test
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

---

## üéØ Quick Start (TL;DR)

```bash
# 1. Enable email/password auth in Supabase dashboard
# 2. Create test user (test@playwright.local / TestPassword123!)

# 3. Install and run
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:headed

# 4. View results
npm run test:report
```
