## 🧪 Manual Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Access the Application

1. Open browser: http://localhost:3000
2. Login with test credentials:
   - Email: `test@playwright.local`
   - Password: `TestPassword123!`

### Step 2: Upload Test Document

1. Click "Upload Document" or drag and drop
2. Select: `Sample documents/test-contract-arlanda.txt`
3. Wait for text extraction to complete (~3-5 seconds)

### Step 3: Configure Prompts

1. Select schema: **"Swedish Contract (Railway)"**
2. Verify the system prompt shows:
   - "Your response must contain ONLY valid JSON"
   - "Do NOT include markdown"
   - "YYYY-MM-DD" date format
3. Click **"Next: Select Models →"**

### Step 4: Select Models

1. Click **"Select All Free"** (or manually select 5-9 free models)
2. Note the model count shown on the "Run X Models" button
3. Click **"Run X Models"**

### Step 5: Wait for Results

- **Expected time:** 1-2 minutes for all models
- **Progress indicator:** "Running..." should appear
- **Completion:** Results section will appear

### Step 6: Verify Quality Scores

Check that each successful model shows:

**Quality Scores (0-100):**
- **Syntax Quality** - JSON formatting
- **Structural Quality** - Object nesting
- **Completeness** - Information depth
- **Content Quality** - Data consistency
- **Consensus** - Agreement with other models
- **Overall Score** - Weighted average

**Expected Display:**
```
Model Name: mixtral-8x7b
Overall: 87/100

Syntax: 95 | Structural: 90
Complete: 85 | Content: 88
Consensus: 75
```

### Step 7: Check Database

Open Supabase dashboard and verify quality scores are populated:

```sql
SELECT
  model,
  json_valid,
  quality_syntax,
  quality_structural,
  quality_completeness,
  quality_content,
  quality_consensus,
  quality_overall
FROM outputs
WHERE run_id = 'LATEST_RUN_ID'
ORDER BY quality_overall DESC;
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### Success Rate
- **Baseline (Before):** 11% (1/9 models)
- **Target (After):** 60-80% (5-7/9 models)
- **Improvement:** ~50-70 percentage points

### Quality Score Distribution

**90-100:** Exceptional - Perfect JSON, complete extraction
**80-89:** Excellent - High quality, minor issues
**70-79:** Good - Reliable extraction, acceptable quality
**60-69:** Fair - Usable but needs review
**<60:** Poor - Significant issues, don't trust

### Model Rankings

**Expected Top Performers:**
1. Mixtral 8x7B (80-90 range)
2. Llama 3.1 70B (75-85 range)
3. Qwen 2.5 72B (70-80 range)

**Expected Challenges:**
- Smaller models (8B-14B) may score 60-75
- Some models may still produce invalid JSON (<60)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: No Quality Scores Shown

**Check:**
1. Edge Functions deployed correctly
2. Database migration applied
3. Latest code pulled from repository

**Fix:**
```bash
# Redeploy Edge Functions
export SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=sbp_8492609bfa82d170d97716348b7719a55a28c62f
npx supabase functions deploy run-llm-inference --project-ref ughfpgtntupnedjotmrr
npx supabase functions deploy calculate-consensus --project-ref ughfpgtntupnedjotmrr
```

### Issue: All Models Failing

**Check:**
1. System prompt being used correctly
2. OpenRouter API key valid
3. Models available on OpenRouter

**Fix:** Review system prompt in UI, ensure it contains English instructions

### Issue: Consensus Score is 0

**Expected:** Consensus score calculated only after calling calculate-consensus
**Fix:** Call the consensus endpoint after inference:
```bash
curl -X POST https://ughfpgtntupnedjotmrr.supabase.co/functions/v1/calculate-consensus \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"runId": "YOUR_RUN_ID"}'
```
