# Quality Scoring System - Test Results

**Test Date:** 2025-10-27T08:03:15.444Z
**Test Document:** test-contract-arlanda.txt (Swedish railway contract)
**Models Tested:** 0 free models

---

## üéØ Test Objectives

1. Validate 5-dimensional quality scoring system
2. Measure improvement over baseline (11% success rate)
3. Verify cross-model consensus analysis
4. Confirm quality scores guide users to best outputs

---

## üìä Results Summary

### Success Rate
- **Baseline (Before):** 11% (1/9 models)
- **Current (After):** 0.0% (0/0 models)
- **Target:** 60-80%
- **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS INVESTIGATION

### Models Performance
| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| ‚úÖ Valid JSON | 0 | 0.0% |
| ‚ùå Failed | 0 | 100.0% |

## ü§ù Consensus Analysis

‚ö†Ô∏è Consensus analysis not available (requires 2+ successful models)

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Results

| Test | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Success rate improved | ‚ùå FAIL | 0.0% > 11% baseline |
| Quality scores calculated | ‚úÖ PASS | All successful models have scores |
| Scores in valid range | ‚úÖ PASS | All scores between 0-100 |
| Best model identified | ‚ö†Ô∏è N/A | No valid outputs |
| Consensus analysis | ‚ö†Ô∏è LIMITED | Needs 2+ successful models |

## üîç Quality Scoring Breakdown

### 1. Syntax Quality (25% weight)
- Valid JSON syntax
- No markdown code blocks
- No extra text before/after JSON
- Proper data types (numbers as numbers)

### 2. Structural Quality (20% weight)
- Object structure (not array/primitive)
- Nested structure depth
- Consistent depth across sections
- Proper use of null vs empty strings

### 3. Completeness (20% weight)
- Number of top-level fields
- Depth of nested information
- Non-null value ratio
- Array content (not empty)

### 4. Content Quality (20% weight)
- Date format consistency (ISO 8601)
- Reasonable numbers
- Meaningful text values
- Field naming consistency

### 5. Consensus Score (15% weight)
- Field name agreement with other models
- Value agreement with other models
- Structure similarity
- Completeness vs top performers

---

## üìà Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced System Prompt
- **Language:** Swedish ‚Üí English (better model comprehension)
- **Explicit Requirements:** "Your response must contain ONLY valid JSON"
- **Prohibited Patterns:** No markdown, no extra text
- **Format Specifications:** ISO dates, numeric types, exact field names

### 2. Quality Scoring System
- **Dynamic:** Works with any document/prompt
- **Multi-dimensional:** 5 independent quality measures
- **Actionable:** Clear scores guide user decisions

### 3. Consensus Analysis
- **Cross-validation:** Compare outputs across models
- **Field/Value Agreement:** Identify consensus
- **Recommendations:** Rank models by quality

---

## üéØ Conclusion

**‚ö†Ô∏è INVESTIGATION NEEDED:** Success rate did not improve as expected. Check: (1) Edge Functions deployed correctly, (2) System prompt being used, (3) Model availability.

### Next Steps
- Review failed model outputs for common patterns
- Consider additional prompt enhancements
- Test with premium models to establish upper bound
